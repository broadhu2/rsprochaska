I want to create ideas that are the catalyst to memories. Our environment, both built and natural, is as relevant to the creation of influential memories as are the people that inhabit it.

I approach this mentality through architecture and photography. Photography allows me to document how I observe my surroundings, a mentality I describe further [here](). These impressions are further studied through my current work at Kyle May Architect.

The projects presented on this site demonstrate how I have approached this mentality, crafting designs and ideas that positively influence others, as I have been myself. If you have any questions or are interested in discussing possible projects, you can reach me [here]().
